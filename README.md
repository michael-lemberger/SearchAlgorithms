# SearchAlgorithms
Implemntation for Problem-solving algorithms, with algorithms like A-star, BFS, DFID, DFBnB, and IDA-star. (Can be found in my Github

Artificial Intelligence Search Methods for Problem Solving:
The problem:
A sliding puzzle. The slide puzzle is called a board, and we try to solve it.
every number is a tile, a tile cand have a cost for moving it, and it can be unmoveable.

We try to solve it using the algorithms above. We aim to use as few steps as possible, with the lowest cost.

Note that every algorithm has a different result.
