# SearchAlgorithms
<h3>Implemntation for Problem-solving algorithms, with algorithms like A-star, BFS, DFID, DFBnB, and IDA-star.<h3>

<p>Artificial Intelligence Search Methods for Problem Solving:
The problem:
A sliding puzzle. The slide puzzle is called a board, and we try to solve it.
every number is a tile, a tile cand have a cost for moving it, and it can be unmoveable.</p>

(p>We try to solve it using the algorithms above. We aim to use as few steps as possible, with the lowest cost.</p>

<p>Note that every algorithm has a different result.</p>
